. BUGS:
    . Rotation90 -> FlipX  actually flip Y from user point of view

. Add showing of helpers:
    Show outline based on tile error:
       Red - incorrect placement
       Orange - correct placement incorrect flip/rotation
. Show currently active tile ( possible hole) :
    . Surrounding outline ?
    . Bloom ?
. Move PuzzleAssets as a component on the Puzzle Entity
    
. Test non fully orthographic cameras

. Support two type of puzzle source:
    . One Full Puzzle Image, width/height: These needs shuffling, solution is know to engine
    . One image and value per tile,  total score. Brute force = size! * 7^size
. Add a scoring system:
    . Number of actions ?
    . Time for completions ? ( Requires start countdown)

. UI:
    . Puzzle creation menu:
        FromImage:
        . Image choice
        . difficulty choice:
            . size 
            . flips ? / rotation ?
            . shuffling steps SMALL MEDIUM FULL
            . Hole position: bottomRight / Random.
        . Helper levels:
            . None
            . Solution overlay
            . Tile state: (Red/orange)
            . Solution steps.
        FromPreComputed:
            . Choice from an available list
            . Each entry contains metadata with its information ( size, flips ? , rotation ? , random hole ?)
            . No helper available.
    . Puzzle in solving UI:
        . Current score ?

. Puzzle solver:
    . For Puzzle with solutions, compute shortest steps to reach solution.
      This is not the reverse of the shuffling steps, as best score can be lower.
