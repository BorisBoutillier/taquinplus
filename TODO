. BUGS:
    
. CLEANING:
    . Better separate action event handling between, entity and non-entity related parts
    . Better handle action counting, should be purely Puzzle internal
    . Support starting without an active puzzle, need test on all 'single_mut'
. IMPROVEMNTS:
    . Add proper support for non-square puzzles.
    . Test using a Violet outline to show misplaced+misoriented
    . Move PuzzleAssets as a component on the Puzzle Entity
    . Check how to improve separation between inherant puzzle content and display content.
    
. FEATURES:
    . Add time keeping, in second but finally reported with 0.1s granularity
    . Add a 'Go' button with countdown to start ( bluring the puzzle ?), necessary for completion time scoring.
    . Add support for non-solvable puzzle, provided as an array of image and score, and a final score.
    . Add a puzzle solver, than it run after the shuffling. Should reach minimal actions, so as to allow the user to compare.
    . Add solving viewer.
    . Add support for random hole position
    . Add Mouse base actions:
        . Move over a tile make it active
        . tile corner = rotation. Shown with a rotated arrow appearing

        WS: Y flip
        AD: X flip
        Q: Rotate CCW
        E: Rotate CW
